# alertmanager-client-go
Go client for https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager API. Useful for automatic end-to-end tests.


EDIT: Created this repo, since I needed such thing, but aborted any effort - it seems that it will be soon available in https://github.com/prometheus/client_golang!

See https://github.com/prometheus/client_golang/pull/263 for details. Specifically:

https://github.com/tcolgate/client_golang/blob/dbbee72205671eecf7f42cf802b807c03f23a744/api/alertmanager/api.go
